		  <p><br>This is a 3D animated blocky bunny with natural movement and controllable parts! It has animated features that allow it to <i>look around, move its arms, or wave.</i> There is also a camera feature to pan around the bunny. Feel free to play around with it below!</p>
		  <p>The bunny is actually made from a lot of triangles, which were formed from individual points. This program started as a paint program that drew points, and then triangles, and now it is a blocky bunny! GLSL is used to create the illusion of depth.</p>

		  <p>This was a hackathon entry for CruzHacks 2020. None of us had known how to code in Swift prior to the hackathon, but it was satisfying to make a functional iOS app. While working on the project, we ran into a few problems:
		  	<br><br>&emsp;1. Not everyone owned an Apple device and could code in Xcode
		  	<br>&emsp;2. None of us knew how to code in Swift
		  	<br>&emsp;3. We all mostly had backend development experience
		  <br><br>To solve the first two problems, we mostly worked in pairs. Each pair (or group of three or individual) would be in charge of one component from research to execution. Then, each pair took turns coding their component on a laptop with Xcode; this allowed our team to work efficiently despite limitations. As for the last problem, I was the only one on the team with some UI/UX experience <i>(thank you game design classes)</i>, so I decided to oversee the frontend development. Although our entry could barely compare to the other impressive apps and innovations, the experience that I gained from coding in a team was invaluable.
